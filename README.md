Pewlett Hackard is a large company with thousands of employees who have been there for a long time. As these people are approaching retirement, the company is looking into the future in two ways. Firstly, it is offering retirement packages for employees meeting the criteria and second, its starting to think about the thousands of new job openings that will result from upcoming retirements.

Bobby is the HR analyst whose task is to perform employee research. He will have to check who will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions the company needs to fill.
